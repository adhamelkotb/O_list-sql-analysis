--  NULL Values Check in "orders" Table
-- We are validating critical columns for data quality.
-- Key Points:
-- 1. Essential columns like order_id, order_status, and order_purchase_timestamp
--    must never be NULL for any order.
-- 2. Timestamp columns related to delivery (approved, carrier, customer, estimated)
--    are expected to be NOT NULL only when the order_status is 'delivered'.
-- 3. Therefore, filtering for 'delivered' orders is applied only to delivery-related columns.
-- This helps ensure that missing data is evaluated in context, improving data accuracy for analysis.
